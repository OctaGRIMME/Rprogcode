# Lexical Scoping

Lexical scoping (sometimes known as static scoping ) is a convention used with many programming languages that sets the scope (range of functionality) of a variable so that it may only be called (referenced) from within the block of code in which it is defined. The scope is determined when the code is compiled. A variable declared in this fashion is sometimes called a private variable.

Lexical scoping in R means that the values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined.

This is the code for lexical scoping in R
